  Recently, I've been seeing a lot of people coming up with one excuse for not linking the dupelicate topic in the suggestions forum. They say something like,
  <div style="background-color: #979797; text-align: right; padding: 3px;">I'm on mobile!!!!! 😖😭😫</div>
  this is not a correct argument, so I've decided to make this post to prove it.
  <h1>Safari/iOS</h1>
  the way that you copy and paste on Safari is by double taping on the text, then dragging until you've selected all the text<span style="color: #FF0000;">(the next bit works for links, not this)</span>
  <h2>Coping links</h2>
  tap and hold on the link until you see:

  <h2>Paste</h2>
  going to any textbox, in the top-left-hand conner, you should see a little clipboard icon(as long as you aren't selecting any text), press it.
  tap "copy(circled in <span style="color: #FF0000;">red</span>)"
  <div style="background-color: #ff0004; color: #00FFFF; text-align: center;">🏷Note: I don't own an android tablet or phone, so take this with a grain of salt</div>
  <h1>Chrome/Android</h1>
  press and hold until a few selection boxes come up(might work for links)
  <h2>pasting</h2>
  tap and hold int the text box, you should see "paste," now click that(boxed in <span style="color: #FF0000;">:
