# Creating New Posts
## JSON temp:
```json
"--name of post--": {
	"pD": "--date of writing--",
	"fT": "--not currently in use--",
	"pC": "--Content of the post--"
}
```
## Creating the Content:
1. Create the write the thing
2. Remove all indents and new lines
3. Replace all  `"` & `/`s with `\"` & `\/`
4. Once you're done writing it, make sure to add it's name to the name list found in `script.js`
